# What is continuous integration?

Some works needs to happen here...

- What is CI
- Why is CI useful
- Example platforms people use and what most people use
- How to integrate it into your maintenance workflow... (Examples)

on this page i think we can show various CI builds and talk about how they work.

we can then in the future link to our example package where those builds run.
and to tutorials

below is duplicate text...

## CI Environment

CI Environment: When youâ€™re ready to publish your code online, you can setup Continuous Integration (CI). A CI platform will allow you to not only run your tests on various Python versions but also different operating systems like Mac, Linux and Windows. Tools like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD make it easy for you to run tests on various Python versions, and even on Windows, Mac, and Linux. CI can finally be configured to ensure that tests run on every push and pull request to your repository. This ensures that any changes made to your package are tested across operations systems and Python versions before they are merged into the main branch of your codebase. &lt;<tests in ci link here>>

By embracing these testing practices, you can ensure that your code runs as you expect it to across the diverse landscapes of user environments.
