# Complex Python package builds

This guide is focused on packages that are either pure-python or that
have a few simple extensions in another language such as C or C++.

In the future, we want to provide resources for packaging workflows that require more complex builds. If you have questions about these types of package, please [add a question to our discourse](https://pyopensci.discourse.group/) or open an [issue about this guide specifically in the GitHub repo for this guide](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/python-package-guide/issues). There are many nuances to building and distributing Python packages that have compiled extensions requiring non-Python dependencies at build time. For an overview and thorough discussion of these nuances, please see [this site.](https://pypackaging-native.github.io/)

## Pure Python Packages vs. packages with extensions in other languages

You can classify Python package complexity into three general categories. These
categories can in turn help you select the correct package front-end and
back-end tools.

1. **Pure-python packages:** these are packages that only rely on Python to function. Building a pure Python package is simpler. As such, you can chose a tool below that has the features that you want and be done with your decision!

2. **Python packages with non-Python extensions:** These packages have additional components called extensions written in other languages (such as C or C++). If you have a package with non-python extensions, then you need to select a build back-end tool that allows you to add additional build steps needed to compile your extension code. Further, if you wish to use a front-end tool to support your workflow, you will need to select a tool that supports additional build setups. We suggest that you chose build tool that supports custom build steps like Hatch.

3. **Python packages that have extensions written in different languages (e.g. Fortran and C++) or that have non Python dependencies that are difficult to install (e.g. GDAL)** These packages often have complex build steps (more complex than a package with just a few C extensions for instance). As such, these packages require tools such as [scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   or [meson-python](https://mesonbuild.com/Python-module.html) to build. NOTE: you can use meson-python with PDM.

## Mixing front-end and back-end projects

It is sometimes necessary or desirable to use a build front-end with an alternative build-backend.
This is because some front-ends do not have a default back-end (`build`), and this choice is placed on the maintainer.
Other back-ends (`hatch`) have a preferred back-end (`hatchling`) but allow the maintainer to migrate to another, while
some back-ends (`poetry`) only work with a single back-end (`poetry-core`). Refer to (#python-package-build-tools) for
more information about front-end and back-end compatibility.

In this packaging guide we recommend using `hatch` along with it's preferred back-end `hatchling`. One reason to use
hatch with an alternate back-end is for creating an extension module. A Python extension module is one that is make up,
either in part or entirely, of compiled code. In this case the back-end chosen (such as `meson-python`) must know how to
compile the extension language and bind it to Python since `hatchling` is only capable of building pure Python modules.

In order to use a different back-end you will need to edit your project's `pyproject.toml`. If you have a
`pyproject.toml` generated by the `hatch` command, or from following the packaging tutorial, you may have
to make a change like this

```diff
 [build-system]
-requires = ["hatchling"]
+requires = ["meson-python"]
-build-backend = "hatchling.build"
+build-backend = "mesonpy"
```
